# youtube-typescript

A simple project done for the [react-redux course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux) on udemy.
The only twist is this is done in typescript instead of just es6.

##Setup

- Run `npm install`
- Then run `npm start`
- open [localhost:80/webpack-dev-server](localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)
